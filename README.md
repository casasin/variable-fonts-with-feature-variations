# Building variable fonts with Feature Variations

This document is a step-by-step guide for building a variable font using Feature Variations. It includes tips and insight about common problems. It builds upon Travis Kochel's guide for variable fonts and Miguel Sousa's documentation on Adobe variable font prototype. 
For this guide the source files should be in UFO format and fonttools, fontmake and TTX need to be installed. Scary Terminal and a good text editor are necessary.
It's not a workflow proposal or sugegstion, rather than personal notes and things that I discover whikle making TypeTogether Protipo Variable. Many of these steps can be surely scripted and be accessible through nice interfaces, hopefully soon and probably not by me! In the meantime I hope these notes can be helpful to all average-human-level type designers.
