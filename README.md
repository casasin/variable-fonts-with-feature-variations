# Building variable fonts with Feature Variations

This document is a step-by-step guide for building a variable font using Feature Variations. 
It includes tips and insight about common problems. It builds upon [Travis Kochel's](https://github.com/scribbletone) [guide for variable fonts](https://github.com/scribbletone/i-can-variable-font) and [Miguel Sousa's](https://github.com/miguelsousa) documentation on [Adobe variable font prototype](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/adobe-variable-font-prototype/graphs/contributors).

For this guide the source files should be in UFO format and fonttools, fontmake and TTX need to be installed. Scary Terminal and a good text editor are necessary.

Many of these steps will surely be scripted and be accessible through nice interfaces, hopefully soon and probably not by me! In the meantime I hope these notes can be helpful to all average-human-level type designers.
